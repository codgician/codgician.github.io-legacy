Time flies very fast. 

As a competitive programmer, retirement is around the corner. Here I am sharing all the things I've created and crafted while solving problems, with my wish that it could help you - the brave warrior who follows the path I once roamed.

- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/codgician/Competitive-Programming) for all codes I've written;
- [Code template](/zh-hans/icpc/templates) orgainized by myself (Chinese);
- [Solutions & notes](/zh-hans/tags/competitive-programming) I wrote (Chinese).
